## Information Regarding Using the Pcard:

### Genaral procedure
1. Email Erma Santander [ermasan@arizona.edu](mailto:ermasan@arizona.edu) before the p-card is used, so she can log every purchase and keep an eye out for fraud.
2. She will require the signed authorization form before the p-card can be used. 
3. The person using the p-card would then send Cindy Barnett [barnettc@arizona.edu](mailto:sbarnettc@arizona.edu) their receipt and the HAS P-card form [pcard_authorization_form)](https://has.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/2023-07/P-Card%20Authorization%20Form.pdf) right away. Cindy has 10 business days after the p-card purchase hits our account to approve and enter the corresponding account information.
4. Pcard policy indicates Erma is the pcard holder. She is the only authorized person to release the pcard out for use.  For audit purposes, the Pcards must be checked out and logged at every use; the consequence being the removal of our department pcard.
5. Failure to following these instructions will result in an individual’s pcard privileges discontinued.
